            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m <strong>Joy Ndanu Mweu</strong> — a Computer Science student at 
                <strong>Kiriri Women’s University of Science and Technology</strong>, passionate about 
                leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the Academic Representative, I’ve led initiatives that enhance student welfare and 
                championed access to quality digital tools. I’ve participated in hackathons, forums, and 
                leadership events that shape young women in STEM. My journey combines creativity, data, 
                and impact — from machine learning models to community projects.
